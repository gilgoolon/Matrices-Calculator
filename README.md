# Matrices Calculator
based on JavaFX graphics and was built using no libraries.

The program recieves 2 (or one, depending on the operation) matrices of any size (from GUI) and outputs the result of the operation.
Currently, supporting the following operations:
* Add 2 matrices
* Multiply 2 matrices (with n=k)
* Make a matrix canonical
* Find the diagonal form of a matrix (if diagonalizable)
* Solve a matrix as a set of linear equations
* Compute the determinant of a matrix

This project was done for fun, inspired by the courses Linear Algebra and Introduction to Cryptography.
